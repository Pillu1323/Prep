// Lets Revise 
* A document is made up of { curley braces & a key: value pair}
* Key can also be called as field
* A number doensn't need quotation marks around it

* insertMany (accepts a no. of ducuments in an [array])
* we can also use insert, but it is not recommended

* you can define your own ids, but that has to be _id
> db.hobbies.insertMany([{_id:'sports', name: 'Sports'},{_id:'Cooking', name:'Cooking'}, {_id:'Cars',name:"Cars"}])
{
        "acknowledged" : true,
        "insertedIds" : [
                "sports",
                "Cooking",
                "Cars"
        ]

// 
* Ordered insert 
1. we already have an document, if we try to insertMany documets and if it contains already 
  existed document, then it trow an error. 
  Suppose db.persons.insertMany([{1}, {2},{3}]) here document{2} is already existed then 
  persons collections will get added {1} and it trows an error when it deals with {2}. and {3} 
  will not get added. This is the Default behaviour of MongoDB. Sometimes we want this
  behaviour and Sometimes not.

  So if we do not want this behaviour than pass a second argument as:
  db.persons.insertMany ([{4}, {2},{6}],{ordered: false}) then we still get the error as {2} is 
  already existed. But we get {4} and {6} inserted.
